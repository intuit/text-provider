# `text-provider` example

This folder contains a very basic example on how to
use the `text-provider` library in your own React project.
This sample is based on the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) sample application.

## Running the sample

To run the sample on your local machine, clone this
repository and then follow the below instructions:

```sh
# clone this repo
$ git clone git@github.com:intuit/text-provider.git

# move to examples folder
$ cd examples

# install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the sample project
$ npm run start
```

If you wish to use `yarn` instead of `npm` replace the last
2 commands with the ones below:

```sh
# install the dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the sample project
$ yarn run start
```

Happy Hacking!
